# Articles for Teaching Quantitative Methods in Political Science Repository
This repository compiles academic articles in Political Science and Economics that can be used for teaching quantitative methodology. The first spreadsheet uploaded gathers studies about discrimination of different minority types using experimental and observational data, published after 2014 in top journals. The spreadsheets will be updated regularly. More is to come :)

This repository was idealized by Prof. Umberto Mignozzetti (Emory University) and created by Catarina Roman.

Please refer to Kosuke Imai's <a href="http://qss.princeton.press/">_Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction_<\a> for references of how to come up with exercises and stimulate replication of these papers. The book also compiles a number of other studies and datasets students should access easily.
