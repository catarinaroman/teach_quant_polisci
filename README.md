# teach_quant_polisci
This is a repository of academic articles in Political Science and Economics that can be used for teaching quantitative methodology. The first file to be uploaded gathers studies about discrimination of different minority types using experimental and observational data, published after 2014 in top journals. The spreadsheets will be updated regularly. More is to come.
